## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Iqbal (@dibaliqaja)

## Why have this blog?

> Tie knowledge by writing it

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment or hear your thoughts on what I wrote <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
